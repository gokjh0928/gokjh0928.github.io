            Hi, my name is Jay Kim and I am currently an undergrad Computer Engineering student
            at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I have moved multiple times throughout
            my life, born in Korea and having lived in the east coast, west coast, and now in the midwest.
            My hobbies consist of working out, playing badminton, playing the violin, and watching anime.
            The reason why I joined Coding Temple's bootcamp is because I believe that full-stack web development
            is a useful skill to know and I have had difficulties trying to learn about this is in a non-structured
            way. As of now, coding languages familiar to me are x86 assembly, C/C++, and Python, and I am looking
            forward to learning more!
        </p>
