                Hi, my name is Jay Kim and I am currently an undergrad Computer Engineering student
                at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I have moved multiple times throughout
                my life, born in Korea and having lived in the east coast, west coast, and now in the midwest.
                The reason why I joined Coding Temple's bootcamp is because I believe that full-stack web development
                is a useful skill to know and I have had difficulties trying to learn about this is in a non-structured
                way. As of now, coding languages familiar to me are x86 assembly, C/C++, and Python, and I am looking
                forward to learning more!
            </p>
